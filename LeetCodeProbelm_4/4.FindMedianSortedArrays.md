#  Leetcode: Find Median of Two Sorted Arrays

This repository contains a clean, beginner-friendly solution to the classic **Leetcode problem**:

**Problem:**  
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the **median** of the two sorted arrays.

---

##  Problem Statement

> The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))** (for optimal solution),  
> but this solution solves the problem using a **simple sorted + math approach**, great for learning.

---

##  Approach

We:
1. Combine both arrays
2. Sort the combined array
3. Find the **median** based on whether the length is even or odd

I originally tried solving this in C++, but switching to Python made it 100x easier.
It took me a few hours to think through the constraints, especially since the problem mentions a desired time complexity of O(log n) which means using for loops (O(n)) is too slow.
After trying different approaches and understanding the logic, I finally arrived at this solution. It might not be the most optimal (like true binary search), but it works and helped me understand the logic deeply.
If you know a faster solution or something even close to O(1), Iâ€™d love to hear how you did it.
